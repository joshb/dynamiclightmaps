This is an OpenGL demo featuring dynamic lightmaps,
created for an article at http://www.3ddrome.com/
It's been developed and tested on Slackware Linux.

To build it, just run 'make' (you may have to edit the
Makefile). This will create an executable called 'main'
that you can then run - press the space bar to toggle
lighting in the demo.

The code is distributed under a BSD-style license.
